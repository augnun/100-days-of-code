# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 17th, 2019

*Today's Progress*: Decided to start working on this challenge, I plan on working on a Kaggle Kernel for at least an hour for 100 days from now

*Thoughts*: Very excited about this, even though Kaggle seems a bit distracting at times their Kernel/Notebook interface has improved a lot

### Day 2: January 18th, 2019

*Today's Progress*: Realized that I'm not that versed with Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, sklearn et cetera. Gonna have to catch up.

*Thoughts*: Really gonna need to study more, faster and more effectively
